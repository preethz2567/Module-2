# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

##  Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

##  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

##  Program
```
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

f = lambda x, y: x + y
result = f(a, b)
print("The sum is:", result)
```

## Output

## Result
Therefore the iven Python program has been executed successfully and the output has been verified.

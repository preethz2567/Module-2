# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

##  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

##  Program
```
a = 16
binary = bin(a)
print(binary)
```

## Output

# EXP 01 - Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

##  Program
```
a = 16
binary = bin(a)
print(binary)
```
## Output

## Result
Therefore the given Python program has been executed successfully and the output has been verified.

# EXP 02 -  Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator

##  Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their **modulo** using the `%` operator.

##  Algorithm
1. Define a function called `result` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`.
2. Inside the function, compute the modulo using `a % b`.
3. Print the result of the modulo operation.
4. Get two integer inputs from the user.
5. Call the `result` function with the user-provided values.

##  Program
```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = a % b
print(c)
```

## Output

## Result
Therefore the given Python program has been executed successfully and the output has been verified.
